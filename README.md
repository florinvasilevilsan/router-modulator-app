# router-moulator-app
A simple application utilizing a routing technique which does not involve regular expressions. It has added features for modularization as well as some hardcoded module samples.

============================================
To Browse the demo simply go to 'http://www.e-libe.com/router//'. Do not disregard the double slash. I you do that you will be browsing the homepage of the website.
The double slash will take you to the admin page where you can view, add, edit and remove routes or modules of the application.
Most of the requests are handled through AJAX.

The code itself, of this repo, might lack commenting as well as it needs refactoring but I will take care of that once I have some free time on my plate.

Have a look, if you think you've got some great ideas, as to how to improve the code, get in touch and we will see where to take it from over there.
